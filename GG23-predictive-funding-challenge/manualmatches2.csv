About

Hey is a decentralized and permissionless social media app built with Lens Protocol 🌿

Hey lives in the Polygon network, so users can interact with dApp seamlessly with zero gas fees. No one can take down any content from the app, even the admins. Hey is powered by Lens Protocol, a decentralized social graph built by Aave companies 👻

The Problems with existing social media

There are a lot of social media platforms out there, and we should agree they provided us great service, but also we should agree there are a lot of problems still persists.

• Personal Information: We need to give a lot of personal information not needed for the platform or useful for consumers.

• Privacy: There is no privacy on the existing platforms. All the data we give are sold for advertisements, and 1000s of mods and admins monitor all our posts and chats.

• Spam: Current model creates tons of spam against the user. Because spamming is free, you don't need to pay money to spam.

• Downtime: The app we use right now is prone to downtime because a single company with limited servers hosts that.

The Problems Hey Solves

• Personal Information: You don't provide any personal information except your username (it's your choice) and wallet address, and we don't collect any sensitive information, and it's difficult to store those in Smart contracts.

• Privacy: Hey or the Lens team doesn't have access to remove your posts, everything you post is public, and you are responsible for it.

• Spam: In Hey, you must sign for everything or by the relay. That's the nature of the Blockchain; no one wants to sign their identity for spamming

• Downtime: Hey is hosted in a decentralized chain and decentralized file storage system IPFS. This means there will be 0 downtimes, and no one can DDoS the platform.

Developing semi-fungible tokens (hypercerts) to track, certify, and reward impactful work in a transparent, interconnected funding ecosystem for public goods.

    The Hypercerts Foundation pioneers open-source protocols to transparently fund and reward positive impact. Hypercerts are the web3 standard to account for impactful work, tracking financial and non-financial contributions.

Where are we headed

Imagine a world where positive impact was one of the most highly valued creations in our society; where entrepreneurs who pursued high-uncertainty, high-upside moonshots to radically improve society were rewarded directly for that impact; where becoming a patron of impactful causes was something people aspired to and displayed proudly; and where the methods used to evaluate impact were credible, transparent, and independently verifiable.

That world might seem a distance away, but it’s one we can build towards. Specifically we’d like to see more impact markets, retroactive funding and innovation in the way we fund public goods. In order for this to occur, we need protocols to track and fund impact.
What are hypercerts?

A single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that’s intended to be impactful, and whose ownership can be fractionalized and even transferred under specific conditions. Each hypercert represents a unique impact claim capturing the following basic information:

    Who: Set of contributors
    What: Scope of work
    When: Time of work

Avoiding silos – interconnected funding system

As an extension of ERC 1155 semi-fungible tokens, hypercerts create a single, open, shared, and decentralized database for funding mechanisms. This database avoids the creation of new funding silos, as hypercerts can be integrated into any existing funding platform, thereby creating an interconnected funding ecosystem.
Selling impact – moving beyond donation

While hypercerts may be useful for any funding mechanism, they’re particularly valuable for retroactive funding as they provide baseline invariant guarantees that impact claims will not be forgotten. Projects create and sell impact, building financially sustainable and scalable revenue models. With hypercerts, we move beyond donations.
Certifying impact – open evaluation system

Certifying impact is a process, and it should be an open and dynamic one. Hence, with hypercerts we create the foundation for an open evaluation system for credible and transparent impact assessment. Every hypercert can receive multiple evaluations from different evaluators using a variety of methodologies. This creates incentives to innovate evaluation methodologies and builds trust.
Where do we go from here

Looking ahead, we aim to expand to more chains, enable evaluations with existing and new tools, enhance visualization with hyperboards, create marketplace tools, and collaborate for broader integration. With your support and a growing network, we're building a transparent interconnected funding ecosystem for positive impact.
The work so far

    We released our whitepaper (draft): https://hypercerts.org/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper-intro
    We have build the core protocol and released it on Goerli Testnet and Optimism
    We have created a frontend for anyone to create hypercerts – available at https://www.hypercerts.org/
    We have build an SDK for anyone to build on top of the protocol: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hypercerts-org/sdk
    We have piloted hypercerts with the last three Gitcoin Rounds (Alpha, Beta, GR18) to show how they can be integrated into funding platforms – you can read more about it here: https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/hypercerts-for-public-goods-funding
    We have piloted hypercerts with the pop-up city Zuzalu, retroactively raising more than 21 ETH: https://zuzalu.hypercerts.org/
    We have created hyperboards to visualize the contributions from multiple hypercerts to a project and piloted this with the conference series Funding the Commons
    We have a core community (TG group: https://t.me/+YF9AYb6zCv1mNDJi) with many projects and platforms exploring how to use hypercerts, e.g. Greenpill+Hypercerts+Gitcoin (https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/better-impact-funding-the-greenpill-hypercerts-gitcoin-combo-move/16477), Gainforest (https://gainforest.earth/), da0/g0v Hypercerts Studio (Taiwan) (https://da0.g0v.tw/), Momus.eth & gitcoinreviews.co: Evaluation platform (https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/reviewing-gitcoin-grantee-impact-momus-eth-gitcoinreviews-co/15215), Longevity prize (https://www.longevityprize.com/)

The work ahead

    Release the core protocol on additional EVM-compatible chains
    Enable attestation, evaluations and supplementary information using existing tools like the Ethereum Attestation Service
    Build out hyperboards, such that any project and event can create them
    Create marketplace tools to sell and transfer hypercerts and add to SDK
    Cooperate with funding platforms and projects to integrate hypercerts and build new applications like prize competitions with hypercerts

Initiative focused on fostering a community and ecosystem for funding public goods across different sectors, through events, partnerships, and integrating funding platforms.

Funding the Commons (FtC) originated as an event series aiming to cultivate a public goods community spanning across the spectrum, including Web2, Web3, research, philanthropy, government, and industry.

Its primary focus is the fostering of innovative public goods funding mechanisms. By leveraging the FtC community, brand, events, extensive resources from key partners, and a growing builder community, the organization aims to establish a sustainable PGF ecosystem, and shape the discourse around public goods funding. This involves integrating existing public goods funding platforms to build a cohesive infrastructure, allocating resources effectively, and incubating innovative projects.

Our current focus is to bootstrap a virtuous cycle of builders creating and integrating public goods funding infrastructure, and leveraging that infrastructure, in addition to the infrastructure of leading PGF protocols, to fund the next wave of builders.

Carmine Finance

Carmine Finance has a simple goal. Take care of crypto risk.

Carmine community takes care of risk through insurance, hedging and monitoring. We are pushing the boundaries of these.

Through Carmine Options AMM blockchain users and protocols can hedge or insure against the risks that apply to them and through DeRisk anyone will be able to monitor those risks.
Carmine Options AMM

Options AMM that allows users not only to buy, but also to sell options. This has cool implications for liquidity providers - it minimizes their risk and increases the usage of provided capital. Alongside standard pairs listings, one can trade options for different underlying assets such as NFT portfolios and more.

We view options as “if statement with market pricing”. Imagine being or not being able to use “if statement” while implementing some software. Implication of viewing options in this way is a revolutionary approach that provides a** major building block to DeFi composability**.

Thing that can easily be build on top of these building blocks include

    Hedging / insuring investments (https://app.carmine.finance/insurance)

    Hedging and insurance against impermanent loss

    Insurance against game commodities price drops

    Insurance against risk of under the water loans (shortfall events)

    Moves us closer to solving the problem of capital efficiency in DeFi

    Many more (https://docs.carmine.finance/carmine-options-amm/use-cases)

The smart contracts are written in a way that anyone who deploys them can easily build products on top of them, or build on top of the already deployed.
DeRisk

A simple open source tool to monitor risks in DeFi.

The high ambition project is just about to be released. The goal is to monitor, estimate and forecast risks associated with behavior of DeFi protocols.

The first major risk that is being monitored is a risk of occurrence of under the water loans. The project aims to quantify this risk and allow anyone to adjust the models, integrate new protocols (data sources) and mainly to provide information so that this risk can be managed in a better way and new products can be built or current ones extended. Imagine being able to use any asset as collateral.
Carmine Governance

We believe builders on StarkNet should be laser focused on building their products and not on building tooling or features that are very similar or even the same across different projects. Just as builders don’t create their own IDEs, testing and deployment frameworks and so on, they should not be building their own governance (unless they have a good reason for it), token distributions or spend a lot of time on thinking about where and how to list their token. Spending time on these tasks diverts builders from what matters, especially in the early days of their projects. Simultaneously, there should be multiple options to pick from, the same way you have multiple IDEs, wallets, DEXes and so on.

We are building Governance that will be usable by any protocol on StarkNet. That will save on development time and guide developers through project token creation, token distribution, staking, listing and more. There is a lot ahead of us but we have already released a very early partial version and Carmine Options AMM is using it to guide its decisions.     Carmine Finance

Carmine community takes care of risk through insurance, hedging and monitoring. We are pushing the boundaries of these.

Carmine Finance offers a robust infrastructure that equips the community with advanced tools, promoting self-directed risk management, insurance solutions, and governance within the DeFi ecosystem:

    DeRisk: A platform that facilitates independent risk monitoring and mitigation strategies, enabling users to safeguard their digital assets proactively.

    Options AMM: A foundational tool for the community to create diverse insurance products, allowing for flexible risk coverage tailored to their needs.

    Governance Framework: An accessible and customizable system that empowers any Starknet protocol to innovate with token creation, distribution, and staking, reinforcing community-led governance.""

These are the primary use cases of the products built by Carmine Finance. These open source products enable the creation of multiple other chain-agnostic solutions for protocols. And Carmine Options AMM stitches all of these together, being the powerhouse of the entire product suite.
Description:

Through DeRisk, any protocol built on any chain, will be able to monitor the risk of liquidations.

Open source, serverless, and local-first data hub for Gitcoin Grants data to improve data access and empower data scientists to conduct research!

Visit the portal website to download weekly updates of Gitcoin data packaged as analysis-ready .parquet files!

Instead of fetching data such as donations, projects, rounds or passport scores from multiple APIs you can now get it all from one place, packaged and cleaned!

The Gitcoin Data Portal repository contains code and artifacts to help process Gitcoin Grants data from the Grants Stack Indexer API.

📦 Data portal Pipeline is an instance of datadex allowing you to:

    Add new data sources to the portal, collaborate on better models (ala Dune) or submit an interesting analysis

    Don't ask, fork it and improve the models, add a new source or update any script

    Declarative stateless transformations tracked in git, executed in GitHub Actions and published to IPFS

    Data, artifacts (like the entire DuckDB database), and models all version controlled.

    Share and explore dashboards and reports with the world!

📦 Key Features

    Code, data and infrastructure are fully open source.

    Uses open standards/formats and modular components (Parquet, IPFS, dbt, Dagster).

    Permissionless!

    Clone and edit things away! You're not blocked by any API rate limits, or closed data like in Dune.

    All other git features like branching, merging are available because all the data is transformed declaratively as code.

    Decentralized!

The project runs on a laptop, a server, a CI runner (that's the way is working right now) or a even decentralized compute network like Bacalhau. Oh, it even works in GitHub Codespaces so you don't even need to setup anything locally!

Data is stored in IPFS. You can run it locally, and it'll generate the same IPFS files if nothing has changed. The more people run it, the more distributed the IPFS files will be!

📦 Extra

    It supports all the cool things data engineers want; typing, tests, materialized views, dev branches

    Uses best practices (declarative transformations) and state of the art tooling (DuckDB + Dagster + DBT + Quatro).

    It has integrated publishing platform to surface Jupyter notebooks with useful analyses.

About

Datadex enables people to easily collaborate on Open Data. By using the principles from the Modern/Open Data Stack and tools like dbt and DuckDB it allows anyone to transform/model data by simply writing select statements or importing someone else's ethereum_blocks.sql and building on top of it!

Is like Dune Spellbook, but works on your laptop!
💡 Features

    Open: Play well with the rest of the ecosystem.

    Modular: Each tool can be replaced and extended (adapters). Works well in many environments.

    Flexible. Run it from your laptop, in a cluster, or from the browser.

    Data as Code. Version your data as code thanks to dbt! Publish and share your models for other people to build on top of them.

    Modern: Supports types, tests, materialized views, and more."
