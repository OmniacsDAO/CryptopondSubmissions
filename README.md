# Cryptopond Model Submissions üèóÔ∏èü™ô

A curated collection of **Omniacs.DAO** data-science & ML workflows that competed on the [Pond](https://cryptopond.xyz) platform and adjacent grant contests.  
Each sub-folder is a *self-contained* repo with its own README, dataset layout and scripts; this top-level file simply gives you the ‚Äúgrand tour‚Äù so you can pick the project you‚Äôre after in seconds.

## üìÇ Project index

| Folder | Contest / Challenge | What the model does | Primary tech |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| [`GG23-predictive-funding-challenge`](GG23-predictive-funding-challenge/) | **Gitcoin Grants 23 ‚Äì Predictive Funding** | Embeds every grant description, adds historical round stats and learns two **XGBoost** regressors to forecast both community contributions *and* matching-pool share. Exports three ready-to-upload CSV submissions. | R (`tidyverse`, `ollama`) + Python (`xgboost`, `scikit-learn`) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} |
| [`deep-funding-mini-contest-pipeline`](deep-funding-mini-contest-pipeline/) | **Cardano Deep Funding Mini-Contest** | Scrapes GitHub & OSO BigQuery stats for all repos, generates >1 000 engineered features + doc-embeddings, then trains a *stacked* ensemble (XGB + RF + GB + SVR ‚Üí XGB meta-learner). Also ships a UMAP viewer dataset and a local **Shiny** dashboard for exploratory analysis. | Python (`pandas`, `xgboost`, `umap-learn`), R (Shiny) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| [`sybil-detection-with-human-passport-and-octant`](sybil-detection-with-human-passport-and-octant/) | **Holonym √ó Octant Sybil-Wallet Detection** | Crafts on-chain behaviour & graph-embedding features for wallets on Ethereum + Base, then tunes a **LightGBM** GBDT with Optuna. Three-command pipeline: create venv ‚Üí generate features ‚Üí train & predict. | Python (`networkx`, `node2vec`, `lightgbm`) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |

> **Tip:** each sub-README includes exact CLI commands, dependency lists and data expectations ‚Äì follow them verbatim for reproducibility.

## üîß Quick start for *any* submission

git clone https://github.com/OmniacsDAO/CryptopondSubmissions.git
cd CryptopondSubmissions/<project-folder>
# now follow the 1-2-3 in that folder‚Äôs README

All projects were developed on Linux with Python 3.11 (and, where noted, R ‚â• 4.3).
We recommend using a fresh `virtualenv`/`conda` env per project to avoid version clashes.

## ‚ú® Why these projects matter

* **Public-goods first.** Every model tackles an open-source-funding or Web3-governance pain-point.
* **Reproducibility.** No hidden spreadsheets ‚Äì raw data acquisition, feature engineering and training are all scripted.
* **Interactivity.** Where useful we add dashboards (e.g. Shiny) or view-layer datasets so non-technical DAO members can explore results.

If you use or adapt any of this work, a ‚≠ê on the repo (and maybe a few \$IACS tokens üòâ) is much appreciated!
